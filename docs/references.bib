  abstract = {We have calculated partial final-state resolved radiative recombination (RR) rate coefficients from the initial ground and metastable levels of all elements up to and including Zn, plus Kr, Mo, and Xe, for all isoelectronic sequences up to Na-like forming Mg-like. The data are archived according to the Atomic Data and Analysis Structure (ADAS) data class adf48, which spans a temperature range of z\textsuperscript{2}(10\textsuperscript{1}-10\textsuperscript{7}) K, where z is the initial ion charge. Fits to total rate coefficients have been determined, for both the ground and metastable levels, and those for the ground are presented here. Comparison is made both with previous RR rate coefficients and with (background) R-matrix photoionization cross sections. This RR database complements a dielectronic recombination (DR) database already produced, and both are being used to produce updated ionization balances for both (electron) collisionally ionized and photoionized plasmas.}

  abstract = {To adequately constrain the frequency of energy deposition in active region cores in the solar corona, systematic comparisons between detailed models and observational data are needed. In this paper, we describe a pipeline for forward modeling active region emission using magnetic field extrapolations and field-aligned hydrodynamic models. We use this pipeline to predict time-dependent emission from active region NOAA 1158 for low-, intermediate-, and high-frequency nanoflares. In each pixel of our predicted multi-wavelength, time-dependent images, we compute two commonly used diagnostics: the emission measure slope and the time lag. We find that signatures of the heating frequency persist in both of these diagnostics. In particular, our results show that the distribution of emission measure slopes narrows and the mean decreases with decreasing heating frequency and that the range of emission measure slopes is consistent with past observational and modeling work. Furthermore, we find that the time lag becomes increasingly spatially coherent with decreasing heating frequency while the distribution of time lags across the whole active region becomes more broad with increasing heating frequency. In a follow-up paper, we train a random forest classifier on these predicted diagnostics and use this model to classify real observations of NOAA 1158 in terms of the underlying heating frequency.},

  abstract = {Context: The effects of non-equilibrium processes on the ionisation  state of strongly emitting elements in the solar corona can be extremely difficult to assess and yet they are critically important. For example, there is much interest in dynamic heating events localised in the solar corona because they are believed to be responsible for its high temperature and yet recent work has shown that the hottest ({$\geq$}107 K) emission predicted to be associated with these events can be observationally elusive due to the difficulty of creating the highly ionised states from which the expected emission arises. This leads to the possibility of observing instruments missing such heating events entirely. Aims: The equations describing the evolution of the ionisaton state are a very stiff system of coupled, partial differential equations whose solution can be numerically challenging and time-consuming. Without access to specialised codes and significant computational resources it is extremely difficult to avoid the assumption of an equilibrium ionisation state even when it clearly cannot be justified. The aim of the current work is to develop a computational tool to allow straightforward calculation of the time-dependent ionisation state for a wide variety of physical circumstances. Methods: A numerical model comprising the system of time-dependent ionisation equations for a particular element and tabulated values of plasma temperature as a function of time is developed. The tabulated values can be the solutions of an analytical model, the output from a numerical code or a set of observational measurements. An efficient numerical method to solve the ionisation equations is implemented. Results: A suite of tests is designed and run to demonstrate that the code provides reliable and accurate solutions for a number of scenarios including equilibration of the ion population and rapid heating followed by thermal conductive cooling. It is found that the solver can evolve the ionisation state to recover exactly the equilibrium state found by an independent, steady-state solver for all temperatures, resolve the extremely small ionisation/recombination timescales associated with rapid temperature changes at high densities, and provide stable and accurate solutions for both dominant and minor ion population fractions. Rapid heating and cooling of low to moderate density plasma is characterised by significant non-equilibrium ionisation conditions. The effective ionisation temperatures are significantly lower than the electron temperature and the values found are in close agreement with the previous work of others. At the very highest densities included in the present study an assumption of equilibrium ionisation is found to be robust. Conclusions: The computational tool presented here provides a straightforward and reliable way to calculate ionisation states for a wide variety of physical circumstances. The numerical code gives results that are accurate and consistent with previous studies, has relatively undemanding computational requirements and is freely available from the author.},

Collision strengths {$\Omega$} are scaled and then plotted as functions of the colliding electron energy, the complete range of energies being mapped onto the interval (0, 1). The scaled {$\Omega$} can then be represented to good accuracy by a 5-point spline. Similar scaling and spline fitting techniques enable thermally averaged collision strengths Y to be obtained at all temperatures. Whole isoelectronic sequences may then be treated by mapping the ion charge onto (0, 1) and using a second 5-point spline; thus reducing Y, for the whole sequence and all temperatures, to a 5 \texttimes{} 5 array. Three main types of transition (optically allowed, forbidden and exchange) are discussed separately and illustrated by numerical examples. Interactive programs for analysing atomic data in this way have been developed.},

New data for neutrals and low charge states are also added. The data are assessed, but to improve the modelling of low-temperature plasma the effective collision strengths for most of the new datasets are not spline-fitted as previously, but are retained as calculated. This required a change of the format of the CHIANTI electron excitation files. The format of the energy files has also been changed. Excitation rates between all the levels are retained for most of the new datasets, so the data can in principle be used to model high-density plasma. In addition, the method for computing the differential emission measure used in the CHIANTI software has been changed.},

This review focuses on the optically thin emission from the solar atmosphere, mostly found at UV and X-ray (XUV) wavelengths, and discusses some of the diagnostic methods that have been used to measure electron densities, electron temperatures, differential emission measure (DEM), and relative chemical abundances. We mainly focus on methods and results obtained from high-resolution spectroscopy, rather than broad-band imaging. However, we note that the best results are often obtained by combining imaging and spectroscopic observations. We also mainly focus the review on measurements of electron densities and temperatures obtained from single ion diagnostics, to avoid issues related to the ionisation state of the plasma. We start the review with a short historical introduction on the main XUV high-resolution spectrometers, then review the basics of optically thin emission and the main processes that affect the formation of a spectral line. We mainly discuss plasma in equilibrium, but briefly mention non-equilibrium ionisation and non-thermal electron distributions. We also summarise the status of atomic data, which are an essential part of the diagnostic process. We then review the methods used to measure electron densities, electron temperatures, the DEM, and relative chemical abundances, and the results obtained for the lower solar atmosphere (within a fraction of the solar radii), for coronal holes, the quiet Sun, active regions and flares.},

Methods: A complete set of ground level ionization and recombination rate coefficients has been assembled for all atoms and ions of the elements of H through Zn and inserted into the latest version of the CHIANTI database, CHIANTI 6. Ionization rate coefficients are taken from the recent work of Dere (2007, A\&A, 466, 771) and recombination rates from a variety of sources in the literature. These new rate coefficients have allowed the calculation of a new set of ionization equilibria and radiative loss rate coefficients. For some ions, such as Fe VIII and Fe IX, there are significant differences from previous calculations. In addition, existing atomic parameters have been revised and new atomic parameters inserted into the database. Results: For each ion in the CHIANTI database, elemental abundances, ionization potentials, atomic energy levels, radiative rates, electron and proton collisional rate coefficients, ionization and recombination rate coefficients, and collisional ionization equilibrium populations are provided. In addition, parameters for the calculation of the continuum due to bremsstrahlung, radiative recombination and two-photon decay are provided.

  abstract = {Aims:The interpretation of astrophysical spectra depends directly on a knowledge of the ionization state of the emitting plasma. This is determined, in part, from collisional ionization rate coefficients. The most recent assessments of these were performed by Arnaud \& Rothenflug (1985, A\&AS, 60, 425) and Arnaud \& Raymond (1992, ApJ, 398, 394). Since their work, new laboratory measurements of ionization cross sections have become available as well as the Flexible Atomic Code (FAC) which enables theoretical calculations of these rates. Our goal is to provide a complete set of ionization rate coefficients for the elements hydrogen through zinc. Methods: A scaling law, which assists the analysis of ionization cross sections and rate coefficients, has been developed following the approach of Burgess \& Tully (1992, A\&A, 254, 436). Essentially all available measured cross sections along each isoelectronic sequence have been examined and compared to cross sections calculated with the Flexible Atomic Code (FAC) and with other calculations. Two approaches has been taken to provide a complete set of ionization cross sections. In the first, fits to scaled measured ionization cross sections, particularly for neutral and singly ionized species, are performed. In the second, fits to scaled calculated direct ionization and excitation-autoionization cross sections are performed to provide the remainder of the set. The fits to the cross sections are then integrated over a Maxwellian velocity distribution to derive ionization rate coefficients. Results: A complete set of ground level ionization cross sections and rate coefficients has been developed through the combination of these two approaches. A tabulation of parameter fits to ground level ionization rate coefficients for all atoms and ions of the elements of H through Zn is provided.

  abstract = {In this work, we report on a cold, bright portion of an active region  observed by the Hinode/EUV Imaging Spectrometer. The emitting plasma was very bright at transition region temperatures, and the intensities of lines of ions formed between 105 and 106 K were enhanced over normal values. The data set constitutes an excellent laboratory where the emission of transition region ions can be tested. We first determine the thermal structure of the observed plasma, and then we use it (1) to develop a spectral atlas, and (2) to assess the quality of CHIANTI atomic data by comparing predicted emissivities with observed intensities. We identify several lines never observed before in solar spectra, and find an overall very good agreement between CHIANTI-predicted emissivities and observations.},

A key feature is that the data are assessed and regularly updated, with version 8 released in 2015. Atomic data for modeling the emissivities of 246 ions and neutrals are contained in CHIANTI, together with data for deriving the ionization fractions of all elements up to zinc. The different types of atomic data are summarized here and their formats discussed.

Version 4 has been released, and proton excitation data are now included, principally for ground configuration levels that are close in energy. The fitting procedure for excitation data, both electrons and protons, has been extended to allow nine-point spline fits in addition to the previous five-point spline fits. This allows higher quality fits to data from close-coupling calculations where resonances can lead to significant structure in the Maxwellian-averaged collision strengths. The effects of photoexcitation and stimulated emission by a blackbody radiation field in a spherical geometry on the level balance equations of the CHIANTI ions can now be studied following modifications to the CHIANTI software. With the addition of H I, He I, and N I, the first neutral species have been added to CHIANTI. Many updates to existing ion data sets are described, while several new ions have been added to the database, including Ar IV, Fe VI, and Ni XXI. The two-photon continuum is now included in the spectral synthesis routines, and a new code for calculating the relativistic free-free continuum has been added. The treatment of the free-bound continuum has also been updated.},

(1997, hereafter Paper  I) and the present paper applies the atomic data to the study of extreme ultra-violet emission lines found in the SERTS-89 active region spectrum published by Thomas \& Neupert (1994). Firstly, the emission line ratios that are insensitive to density and temperature are used to check both the quality of the atomic data and the calibration of the instrument. Secondly, we use, where possible, ratios that are sensitive to density to estimate the electron density from different ions. In general we find excellent agreement between theory and observation, providing confidence in both the atomic data in the CHIANTI database and the quality of the SERTS-89 spectrum. Where inconsistencies between theory and observation exist we try to explain them in terms of either inaccuracies in the atomic data or blending of the lines. One consistent discrepancy was that all observed lines that we analysed in the lambr\{430\}\{450\} region were uniformly a factor of 1.5--2.0 weaker than predicted, suggesting that the SERTS-89 calibration may need adjustment in this spectral interval. Serious problems were also found in some of the theoretical predictions for a few ions, especially ion\{Fe\}\{xiv\}.},

Spectra in the ranges 170-212 \AA{} and 246-292 \AA{} show strongly enhanced lines from the upper solar transition region (temperatures 5.4 {$<$}= log T {$<$}= 5.9) allowing a number of new line identifications to be made. Comparisons of Fe VII lines with predictions from a new atomic model reveal new plasma diagnostics, however there are a number of disagreements between theory and observation for emission line ratios insensitive to density and temperature, suggesting improved atomic data are required. Line ratios for Fe VIII also show discrepancies with theory, with the strong {$\lambda$}185.21 and {$\lambda$}186.60 lines underestimated by 60\%-80\% compared to lines between 192 and 198 \AA. A newly identified multiplet between 253.9 and 255.8 \AA{} offers excellent temperature diagnostic opportunities relative to the lines between 185 and 198 \AA, however the atomic model underestimates the strength of these lines by factors of 3-6. Two new line identifications are made for Fe IX at wavelengths 176.959 \AA{} and 177.594 \AA, while seven other lines between 186 and 200 \AA{} are suggested to be due to Fe IX but for which transition identifications cannot be made. The new atomic data for Fe VII and Fe IX are demonstrated to significantly modify models for the response function of the Transition Region And Coronal Explorer 195 \AA{} imaging channel, affecting temperature determinations from this channel. The data will also affect the response functions for other solar EUV imaging instruments such as SOHO/EIT, STEREO/EUVI, and the upcoming AIA instrument on the Solar Dynamics Observatory.},

Total DR and RR rate coefficients for F+ to Zn22+ are presented and the results discussed. By comparison between perturbative and R-matrix results, we find that RR/DR interference effects are negligible even for the lowest-charged F+ member. We also find that the 2 -{$>$} 2 low-temperature DR (no change in the principal quantum number of the core electrons) does not scale smoothly with nuclear charge Z due to resonances straddling the ionization limit, thereby making explicit calculations for each ion necessary. These RR and DR data are suitable for modelling of solar and cosmic plasmas under conditions of collisional ionization equilibrium, photoionization equilibrium, and non-equilibrium ionization.},
