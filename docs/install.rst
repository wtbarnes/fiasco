Installation
=============
The easiest way to install fiasco is via ``pip``,

.. code-block:: shell

   $ pip install fiasco

This will install the package and all needed dependencies.
We plan to make it available as a package on ``conda-forge`` as well in the near future.

To install the development release of the package from GitHub, run:

.. code-block:: shell

   $ git clone https://github.com/wtbarnes/fiasco.git
   $ cd fiasco
   $ pip install -e .
