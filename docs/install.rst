Installation
=============
Currently, fiasco is only available via GitHub. We plan to make it available as a package
on both ``conda-forge`` and pip in the near future. To install the package,

.. code-block:: shell

   $ git clone https://github.com/wtbarnes/fiasco.git
   $ cd fiasco
   $ pip install -e .

This will install the package and all needed dependencies.
