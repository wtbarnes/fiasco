fiasco Documentation
====================

Welcome to the documentation for fiasco version |release|.

fiasco provides a Python interface to the `CHIANTI atomic database`_.
In addition to several high-level abstractions of the atomic data, fiasco also provides many common atomic physics calculations.
The package takes its name from the Italian word *fiasco*, or flask, `the typical style of bottle <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fiasco_(bottle)>`_ used to serve the *Chianti Classico* wine.
It is typically larger and rounder at the bottom and is covered by a straw basket.
In the same way, the `fiasco` package serves up the CHIANTI atomic database.
